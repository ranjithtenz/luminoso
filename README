This is Luminoso2, a tool for learning from domain-specific natural-language
data and common sense background knowledge.

This version does not yet have a GUI.

If you are interested in testing it out, look at the documentation strings in
`luminoso/model.py`, and the examples in `test/test_model.py`. Also see the
`luminoso2.org` file for a list of what's new and what's coming.
