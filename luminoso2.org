# Plans for Luminoso 2

This is an "orgmode" file. It looks vaguely like Markdown, but is designed to
have various features for keeping track of things like to-do lists. Orgmode is
available as a plugin for Emacs, Sublime Text 2 (which I use), and possibly
for vim.

* Design plans [0/7]
  - [ ] New "LuminosoSpace" that can be incrementally trained [0/4]
    - [ ] Figure out {{rough incremental blending}}
    - [ ] Implement the version of SimonFunk SVD from MADLib
      [[http://doc.madlib.net/group__grp__svdmf.html]]
    - [ ] Look into L1-normalization
    - [ ] Document

  - [ ] A variety of possible data sources [0/4]
    - [ ] Text files
    - [ ] SQL
    - [ ] Mongo
    - [ ] Document these

  - [ ] A variety of possible "readers" for text [1/4]
    - [X] simplenlp, English
    - [ ] simplenlp, Japanese
    - [ ] Dependency parser
    - [ ] Document these

  - [ ] Statistics for 'studies', collections of documents in the space [0/4]
    - [ ] Look into chi-squared correlation
    - [ ] Centrality
    - [ ] Interesting concepts (make more interesting)
    - [ ] Document these

  - [ ] HTML/JS interface (job for a UROP?) [0/4]
    - [ ] Some interface for choosing data sources (could be messy!)
    - [ ] Interface for configuration, including choosing a reader
    - [ ] Some way to hook in visualizations (processing.js?)
    - [ ] Document
      - [ ] Tutorial
      - [ ] Workflow

  - [ ] Clustering and labeling to discover canonicals [0/3]
    - [ ] Rafael should finish this for Luminoso 1
    - [ ] Port to Luminoso 2
    - [ ] Use SVC (or something?) to determine unknown labels
    - [ ] Document

  - Visualization [0/0]
    - [ ] New "fisheye" visualizer (Birago?)
    - [ ] different views like MDS

* redesign notes from before
  - Toggle different matrices in the blend
  - Labels: key=value or key=??? pairs, representing information we may
    or may not know about the document
  - Labels and canonicals are categories projected into the space, not
    used to form the space

* rough incremental blending
  - implemented with Divisi2
  - Start with a common sense associative matrix
  - Should common sense actually disappear as the amount of information
    increases?
